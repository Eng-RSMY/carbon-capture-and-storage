# Reservoir, Rock Physics, Time-lapse Seismic, & Geomechanical Modelling of Carbon Capture & Storage

This is my BSc thesis which I defended in 9 August 2019. The repo includes my BSc works with few additions post-BSc that I made to enhance my methodology. 

Notebooks are in the *main* folder:
* 01_reservoir_simulation.ipynb: displays the result of reservoir simulation done in Petrel Eclipse, compute the reservoir pressure increase due to CO2 injection
* 02_rock_physics_modelling.ipynb: computes Vp, Vs, and density change due to CO2 saturation and increasing pressure
